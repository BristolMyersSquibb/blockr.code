             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "nicolas@cynkra.com"),

Description: The code export plugin module provided by 'blockr.core' is
    implemented to be as simple as possible. In order to do so, compromises
    were made in terms of code presentation, wrapping expressions with calls
    to 'with' and 'local', even in cases where this is not strictly necessary.
    This plugin is aimed at exporting more idiomatic code whenever possible.
